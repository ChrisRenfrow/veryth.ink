I decided to start documenting the changes I make to my website through a monthly changelog in an effort to work out in the open more, and so I can look back at a record of my work! I'll append changes as I make them within the period of a month. Without further ado, here's the log for this batch of changes.

---

- {{ git_commit(hash="533f91aa") }} Added footer links to participate as a member of the [Constellation webring](https://webring.club/)
- {{ git_commit(hash="40ed0a3c") }} Reorganized template hierarchy in the theme to allow for head and footer overrides on every page
  - This allows me to display webring links in the footer of *every* page (not just the home page)
- {{ git_commit(hash="84e65ba9") }} Modified the theme macro `list_posts` to show drafted posts rather than ignore them
  - Zola already doesn't generate draft posts by default, so this was redundant
  - It's now possible for me to preview drafted posts locally with `zola serve --drafts`
- {{ git_commit(hash="2fddb0d1") }} Made some minor changes to the home page, including a "no AI" disclaimer
- {{ git_commit(hash="d2decd03") }} Added a simple shortcode (`git_commit`) for linking to a relevant commit given its SHA1
  - You may have guessed that I'm using this shortcode here!
- {{ git_commit(hash="887d1dc4") }} [Added a favicon](/blog/new-favicon/)! <img style="border: none" src="/favicon-light.png" height="16px"/>
- {{ git_commit(hash="b01b8f37") }} Made it so that images using my [`embed_image` shortcode](https://gitlab.com/crenfrow/chrisrenfrow-me/-/blob/7b34d92dafba30ce75164e90b766c8b5cae70cca/templates/shortcodes/embed_image.md?plain=1) mirror the alt text to the `title` attribute, making the alt text visible on hover รก la xkcd
