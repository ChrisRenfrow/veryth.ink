I decided to start documenting the changes I make to my website through a monthly changelog in an effort to work out in the open more, and so I can look back at a record of my work! I'll append changes as I make them within the period of a month. Without further ado, here's the log for this batch of changes.

---

- <GitCommit hash="533f91aa" {...commitProps} /> Added footer links to participate as a member of the [Constellation webring](https://webring.club/)
- <GitCommit hash="40ed0a3c" {...commitProps} /> Reorganized template hierarchy in the theme to allow for head and footer overrides on every page
  - This allows me to display webring links in the footer of *every* page (not just the home page)
- <GitCommit hash="84e65ba9" {...commitProps} /> Modified the theme macro `list_posts` to show drafted posts rather than ignore them
  - Zola already doesn't generate draft posts by default, so this was redundant
  - It's now possible for me to preview drafted posts locally with `zola serve --drafts`
- <GitCommit hash="2fddb0d1" {...commitProps} /> Made some minor changes to the home page, including a "no AI" disclaimer
- <GitCommit hash="d2decd03" {...commitProps} /> Added a simple shortcode (`git_commit`) for linking to a relevant commit given its SHA1
  - You may have guessed that I'm using this shortcode here!
- <GitCommit hash="887d1dc4" {...commitProps} /> [Added a favicon](/blog/new-favicon/)! <img class="not-prose inline-flex w-[16px]" src="/favicon.png" width="32px"/>
- <GitCommit hash="b01b8f37" {...commitProps} /> Made it so that images using my [`embed_image` shortcode](https://gitlab.com/crenfrow/chrisrenfrow-me/blob/7b34d92dafba30ce75164e90b766c8b5cae70cca/templates/shortcodes/embed_image.md?plain=1) mirror the alt text to the `title` attribute, making the alt text visible on hover รก la xkcd
