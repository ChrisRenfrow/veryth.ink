Chris Renfrow (he): Not me adding dozens of CSS rules to a WordPress site to hide the mistakes of plugins I have little control over.

I wanted to document the rules with a little comment to make sure future me (or the next poor soul to take over) knows why they're there, but comments end up in the source so that makes it less than desirable.

Idk, some part of me thought that CSS added through the customization panel would have comments stripped?

Chris Renfrow (he): At least I'm not hurling expletives at the plugins in these comments.

Chris Renfrow (he): I was going to continue working on my Astro site but these emergency WordPress edits have me feeling like not looking at a website ever again for the rest of this evening.
